This is a code challenge from Frontend Mentor.
I'm asked; 
- To build a bar chart component and get it looking as close to the designs in the "designs folder" given to me as possible
And users should be able to:
- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
